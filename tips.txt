“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in JPMorgan Chase’s virtual job simulation on the Forage
platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to
participate in a software engineering team at JPMorgan Chase. 
I had the opportunity to use JPMorgan’s own open source library called
Perspective, to set up my dev environment and to build a live graph that
displays a data feed for traders to monitor. It helped me build gain experience
coding in a realistic context and even provided me with the opportunity to make
an open source contribution at the end. 
Through this program I realized that I really enjoy working on building
technical tools that are used by traders and would love to apply what I've
learned in a software engineering team at a company like JPMorgan Chase.
